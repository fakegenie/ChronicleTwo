# Compile one game unit whose markers stand in for code and data that are not
# decompiled yet, and leave a depfile Ninja can read.
#
#   mwccgap.sh <object> <depfile> <source> [mwcc args...]
#
# tools/mwccgap compiles the source twice: once as written, to learn which
# functions the C++ already defines, and once with each INCLUDE_ASM marker
# replaced by a run of `nop` the size of the function and each INCLUDE_RODATA
# marker by a zeroed array the size of the datum. It then assembles the
# per-symbol files scripts/build/disassemble.py wrote and puts those bytes, and
# their relocations, over the placeholders. scripts/build/postprocess_object.py
# then gives every section retail's name, type, flags and alignment.
#
# A marker names its file's directory from the repository root
# (`ps2/asm/<region>/nonmatchings/<unit>`), so the prefix below is `.`.
#
# A unit's files are assembled several at a time; MWCCGAP_AS_JOBS says how
# many, and 1 makes it one after another.
#
# The second compile reads a temporary file named `.c`, so mwcc cannot tell
# the language from the extension and `-lang` is passed explicitly.
#
# Argument order matters. mwccgap takes the two positionals first and passes
# everything it does not recognise to mwcc, and `--as-flags` takes a list, so
# it has to come last or it swallows the compiler's flags.
