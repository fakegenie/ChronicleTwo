# The toolchain image, with a separate compiler-wrapper build stage:
#   docker build -t chronicletwo_dev --target dev .      # toolchain + diffing tools
#   docker build -t chronicletwo_build --target build .  # one-shot build of the tree
# build.sh, run.sh and dev.sh use the first, with the tree mounted; the second
# bakes a copy of the sources in, for a build that needs nothing mounted but
# rom/. Everything here is plain OCI, so podman works too.
#
# The image is x86_64 because wibo, which runs the Windows-hosted Metrowerks
# compiler and linker, needs a real x86_64 Linux kernel. On an Apple-silicon
# Mac that means an x86_64 colima VM, not Docker Desktop's Rosetta emulation;
# see scripts/host/container.sh.
#
# Debian for glibc (the toolchain binaries are glibc-linked), trixie because
# binutils-mips-ps2-decompals needs glibc 2.38 and bookworm ships 2.36.
# Build the pinned compiler wrapper separately from its runtime dependencies.
