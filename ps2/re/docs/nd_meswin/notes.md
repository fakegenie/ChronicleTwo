# nd_meswin: reverse-engineering notes

`ClsMes::Preset` builds from C++ and passes full-image verification. Its fade
reset uses a typed floating-point assignment with the same retail code.

`ClsMes::GetMesWidth_system` scans the system message's 16-bit codes and
returns the widest line. It expands registered names and display controls,
uses the half-font width for narrow glyphs, and returns -1 for an invalid
message or missing system text. Its C++ implementation matches retail.

`ClsMes::SetGoalCursorXY` targets a yes/no choice coordinate in
`MES_WIN_YESNO`. In other modes it places the selection marker beside the
selected text line, adjusts for centered text, and shifts it by half the
difference between the text width and the widest visible line. Its C++
implementation matches retail.

## C++ draft status
The current unit draft check reports 97 matches and one difference,
`ClsMes::DrawMesWin`. It retains retail assembly in the game build.
Promotion attempts are recorded in `scripts/re/promotion_attempts.tsv`.

The migrated message setters write the window mode, background opacity, packed colours,
message buffers and line widths through `ClsMes` members. `GetNextLineTop` scans until the
next line-feed byte and leaves the pointer just after it; its loop branch layout is sensitive
to how the C++ loop is written. `CheckPosInOutForArea` tests each of the three coordinates
against the unordered pair of corresponding bounds.

Unit of the message window class `ClsMes` (68 members: 67 here, `Init` emitted in dngmenu), its
drawing/placement helpers, a few vector helpers, and the movie caption player (`MovieCC*`).

## Header dependencies
- `ClsMes : public CFont`. `CFont` is owned by unit `font`; `ps2/include/font.hpp` did not exist
  when this header was written, so `nd_meswin.hpp` does not compile until it does. Verified with
  a stub `class CFont { u8 unk_0[0xB8]; void Init(); };` substituted for the include: the header
  compiles and every ClsMes offset below was checked with STATIC_ASSERTs.
- `sizeof(CFont) == 0xB8`: `MovieCCFont` and `dbFont` symbols are 0xB8; `CFont::Init` writes
  0x00..0xB7 (memset 0x80 text, 0x80 fuchi, 0x88 rgba bytes, 0x90..0xB4 ints).
  `ClsMes()` also zeroes CFont's 0xB0/0xB4 after `Init` (same pattern as `CMenuFont()` in
  menucls1); CFont's own constructor is inline and calls `Init()` (Init is called twice in a row
  at the start of `ClsMes()`).
- `RECT` and `RGBAQ_TYPE` had no declaration anywhere in `ps2/include`, no owning class, and
  ClsMes holds both by value, so they are defined here. If another unit (drawwin, font) also
  defines them, one definition must be removed and the other header included.
  - `RGBAQ_TYPE`: 8 bytes {u8 r,g,b,a; float q}; copied with `ld`/`sd` (RgbqToUint,
    GetFontColor) so given `aligned(8)`. Returned by value from `RgbqToUint` and
    `ClsMes::GetFontColor` (hidden return pointer in a0, `this` in a1 — m2c shows it as an extra
    first arg).
  - `RECT`: {x, y, width, height}, same as the first game's `rect.hpp`.
- `mgRect<int>` from `mg_tanime.hpp` (by-value params of the set2DSprite functions).
  `mgCDrawPrim`, `CCharacter2` forward-declared.

## ClsMes size and layout
`sizeof(ClsMes) == 0x2958`: `__nw__FUiP1(0x2958, ...)` in InitDungeonMain, sgInitGyoRace,
CAquaMes::Initialize; globals PauseMes, SystemMessage{,2,3}, EventMes1, HelpMes are 0x2958.
`CDC2Mes` (menucls1) derives from it and starts its own fields at 0x2958. No vtable.

Offset -> evidence (ctor = `__ct__6ClsMesFv`; "Init block" = the reset shared by Preset,
dngmenu `Init__6ClsMesFv` and menucls1 `MenuMesInit`):

  0x1E54 line_indent_on (DrawFont adds line_indent[line]).

0x271C[20] (-1), 0x276C[20] (-1), 0x27BC[20], 0x280C[20], 0x2954. Grep other units with the
owning variable names (DngMess, EventMess, SystemMessage...) if they turn up.

## Member functions
- `Init()` (0x1F38E0, emitted in dngmenu) is the inline reset that Preset and menucls1
  `MenuMesInit` inline too; declared without a body: the drafting agent should define it in the
  class body (Init block above). Its body = Preset up to the switch.
- `GetFontColor(int index, int *fuchi)` returns RGBAQ_TYPE by value. `GetDrawSpeedDef` returns
  float (MyTextureMake compares as float). `GetCaptionOff` returns a byte from save data +0x1C5A8
  (declared u8). `MakeMesWin` both overloads are void (no v0 at return).
- `MyTextureMake_sub` returns 0 / 1 (page) / 2 (0xFF01).
- `AddPage(last, page)`: page_chars[page] = last+1 - sum(page_chars[0..page-1]).

## Enums
- MesWindowMode values from DrawMesWin switch and SetWindowMode (2 is stored as 4; 12 as 0).
  Names beyond FUKIDASHI/YESNO/HELP/FLOATING/VERSATILE_* follow the draw call used.
- MesPreset 0..6 from Preset switch. Names are descriptive, not retail.
- MesCode from SetMesWinTbl, MakeMesWinTbl, MyTextureMake_sub, CalcSpaceW, GetItemNoFromFontNo.
  Other ranges seen but not named: 0xF6xx, 0xF9xx (adds low byte to x), 0xFAEA..0xFAF9 (value
  codes), 0xFAFA..0xFAFF (NameRegistTbl rows), 0xFB00+0xF3..0xFA (value), 0xFBFF, 0xFDE0..0xFDF7,
  0xFFA0..0xFFFF.
- MesLineShade from GetGyouAlpha / GetFontColor (1 halves rgb, 2 alpha 0xFF*alpha>>7, 3 black
  at alpha*0x40>>7 and no outline, 4 rgb unchanged alpha 0 / skipped).

## Matching notes
- `DrawFukidashiShadow` constructs a local `mgCDrawPrim` in the existing
  `message_draw_prim` union. Its two stack stores at offsets 0x190/0x194 are
  `mgCDrawPrim::offset_x` and `offset_y` relative to the local primitive at
  stack offset 0x80. They hold the draw offset multiplied by 16, and replacing
  a separate scratch array with those typed fields gives a 100% match.

## Globals
- `p` (.data, 0x80): float[16][2] bubble outline ratios (DrawFukidashi_sub, DrawFukidashiShadow).
- `waku_data` (0x90): s32[9][4] frame margins per window mode (left, top, right, bottom);
  indexed `window_mode*0x10`, so modes 9..11 read past its end in retail.
- `MesAbsDrawOff` s32 (gates DrawFont/_set2DSprite). `MovieCCCnt/W/H` s32.
- `NameRegistTbl` 0xB0 = short[8][11] (row stride 0x16; SetAndGetNameRegistTbl clears rows 0..5
  to 0xFF00).
- `MovieCCFont` CFont (0xB8; constructed by `__sinit_nd_meswin_cpp` via inline CFont ctor).
- `MovieCCStart/Clear` s32[20] (frames = seconds * 25), `MovieCCStr` char[20][350].
- File-local (do not extern): `at_3748` (GetPos_AbsPosSet anchor table, 0x98),
  `data_4206` (0xA0, function-local static), `at_4057`, `at_4100`, and the `at_*` literals.
- `D_0037AFEC` is the .ctor entry.

## First game
First game's `ClsMes` (chronicle `clsmes.hpp`) is a different design (texture-based, 0x1858
bytes). Only the name and the idea of a laid-out character table carry over; no layout reused.

## Compiler flag cleanup

The two local `divbyzerocheck on`/`reset` pairs are redundant with the PS2
compiler flag. Removing them leaves every section and symbol in this unit's
object diff unchanged.

## Canonical native-promotion checks

Under the deterministic Satan's Fiddle profile, the baseline has no native
code failures, including `Preset`; its two canonical failures are the
`MovieCCFont` BSS symbol size (`0xB8` versus retail `0xC0`) and the resulting
padding gap before `MovieCCStart`.

The existing drafts for `SetGoalCursorXY`, `DrawDigit`, `DrawEquipment`,
`DrawCross`, and `DrawRightDelta` retain assembly fallbacks. Isolated canonical
checks identify source scheduling differences rather than floating-constant
selectors: the icon drafts first differ at their texture-rectangle argument
loads (`0x0015B324`, `0x0015B4E4`, `0x0015B69C`). Explicit dimensions can recover
the saved width/height registers for Equipment and Cross, but their x/y load
order still differs. `SetGoalCursorXY` differs in initial integer allocation
and line-count loop scheduling; `DrawDigit` differs in saved integer allocation.
These trial native promotions were restored. No profile rows were accepted.

## Compiler helper history

The unused `PrimeDoubleToFloat` definition remains removed. The translation-unit
profile uses GPR helper mask `0x10` and FPR mask `0`, plus
`native_floating_point: true`. The plain compiler matches `DrawMesWin` but
fails `StepNormal` without that helper state. Keeping the helper calibration
and MWCC's original floating-point handling restores both functions. The
canonical whole-unit check passes `0xBF28` allocated bytes and 1,364 relocations.
The `DrawMesWin` body is unchanged from the verified `216512e1` source apart
from formatting.
