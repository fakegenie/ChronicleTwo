# dngmenu: reverse-engineering notes

`DNGMAP_TEX_POS` is a pair of signed halfword texture coordinates used by the
room-type marker table. The local GLID constants distinguish room and entrance
cells and position adjacent cells by 52 pixels horizontally, -16 pixels of
row shear, and 20 pixels vertically. The tree-map fade-out constant is 40
frames. These names describe the uses visible in the map drawing and fade
functions; they do not assert retail enum names.

`dng_light_circle` and `dngfreemap_num` are const `mgRect<int>` globals: MWCC emits their zero-initialized storage in retail's `.rodata` section and still runs their constructors from the exact 144-byte static initializer. Declaring them without `const` places the storage in `.bss` and breaks the section mapping.

## Current assembly gaps

`CDngFreeMap::CheckIsViewMove`, `DrawRoot`, `DrawRoomOne`,
`DrawTreeMap`, `Draw`, and `LoadDngInfo` retain C++ drafts
under `NONMATCHING`; the matching build selects their retail `INCLUDE_ASM`
gaps. The same applies to `CheckGeoramaMateria`, `DrawDngRoomInfo`,
`DrawGeoramaMateria`, `CMenuTreeMap::InitEnd`,
`MsgInit`, `Step`, and `Draw`, plus `DngTreeMapInit`. The `ClsMes::Init`
body at the end of this unit is also an assembly gap. Match claims elsewhere
in these notes apply only to the named unguarded C++ functions.

## Additional map behavior

`CalcGlidPutPos` maps a cell to board coordinates `x * 52 - y * 16` and
`y * 20`; its final argument selects whether to add the current scroll.
`CheckIsViewMove` clips a point to the view rectangle, reserving 10 pixels
at the right and bottom, and returns the displacement required to bring it
inside. `SetNextRoomPos` applies that displacement to the scroll target.
`SetNextRoomPos` matches retail from C++. `CheckIsViewMove` remains guarded.
Using `right + -10.0f` and `bottom + -10.0f` with float comparisons in the
retail direction reduces its draft to four differing instructions: two
register moves and the placement of the final X displacement across a
floating point branch delay slot. MWCC
emits the retail integer sequence
for `x * 52 + y * -16`; the equivalent subtraction emits a different
sequence. The conversions to float are implicit. `SetTextureInfo` looks up
the `dt`, `dtbg`, `dngop`, and `dtname` textures in that order and also passes
full-image verification from C++.

`ResetDngMapPos` scans the floor grid and calls `CalcGlidPutPos` for cells on
the four boundary lines. The resulting eight local floats are not read after
the scan. It then centres the requested room on `(256, 208)` and uses
`(-100, -100)` when that room is absent. A two-float room position array
produces the retail saved-register and stack sequence; the C++ function
passes full-image verification.

`CDngFreeMap::Initialize` is native and exact with the accepted Satan's Fiddle binary32 286.0 (`0x438F0000`) evaluate-first selector. Separate assignments to `next_pos` and `koma_path` preserve the retail store order. The earlier six-byte constant-load ordering difference is resolved.

`CMenuTreeMap::FadeInOutMenu` tests `draw_hidden` at offset 0x11A before
checking the second fade step. Using that typed field instead of the old
`unk_11a` name yields an exact C++ function and full-image match.

`DrawGlidCheck` inspects a passage cell's four neighbours. It marks adjoining
rooms above and left with bits `2` and `8`; visited boss or sub rooms set
directional bits `0x40`, `0x80`, `0x100`, or `0x200`. The room flag checks
must be separate short-circuit tests for MWCC to emit
retail's branch layout. Initializing the mark mask after the null check
produces both of retail's zero moves. The function passes full-image
verification from C++.

`DrawGlid` draws the room passage outline as a five-vertex red line loop.
Keeping named `top`, `right`, and `bottom` values live between vertex calls
produces retail's `f20`, `f21`, and `f22` allocation. The C++ function matches
all 76 instructions and passes full-image verification. Its generated C++
symbol contains `<f>`, so the guarded promotion helper cannot match the
normalized assembly marker; removing the marker before the full-image check
lets the build's existing symbol normalization handle it.

`DrawBackPattern`
draws a translucent black rectangle in event mode. In menu mode it scrolls
the `dt` backdrop by half a pixel per frame and wraps its offset at the
tile width of 128. The event-mode opacity test converts its integer argument
to float before comparing with zero. An early return for negative opacity and
for negative scroll leaves the exact retail branch destinations; this C++
function passes full-image verification. `DrawLast` covers the menu screen with `dtbg` and passes
full-image verification from C++. `DrawDngName` draws `dtname` twice,
offset by four pixels for its shadow. Its shadow opacity is one quarter
of the requested opacity; the function matches retail from C++ and passes
full-image verification without explicit numeric casts.

`FadeIn` starts at alpha zero and increases by `128 / frames` per step;
`FadeOut` decreases by the same amount. For nonpositive durations, the
step is 128 in magnitude. Both fade functions match retail from C++ and pass
full-image verification. MWCC emits the retail comparison sequence for
`0 < frames`; spelling the equivalent condition `frames > 0` emits a shorter
branch sequence. `SetKomaMove` starts at the second node of the
path because `koma_path` itself is the piece's starting point.

`CheckDngTreeMapFuncType` returns 2 when the menu's `open_type` is 3,
1 when it is 1 or `TreeMapCallDungeonSubMap` is set, and 0 otherwise. The
flag is read as an unsigned byte even though the assembly reservation is
four bytes. `DngTreeMapDraw` reads `DngTreeMode` as a signed halfword and
dispatches modes 0 and 1 to the map or save menu. Both functions match retail
from C++ and pass full-image verification. `CheckGeoramaMateria` walks the
floor's group identifiers, collects the item numbers from matching groups,
then twice removes items whose
attribute word does not contain bit `0x10`.

`DrawPlayer` draws the `dngop` texture at its room's board position, shifted
four pixels right and thirty up. In event mode it takes positions from the
next path node and retains the last position in `dng_player_pos`; in menu
mode it bobs vertically. The shared `dng_player_blink_cnt` wraps at fifty
frames and also modulates the sprite's brightness. `DngTreeMapDraw`
dispatches to the tree map or save menu using the byte `DngTreeMode`.

`CDngFreeMap::Step` advances an active fade, eases each scroll coordinate
one fifth of the remaining distance towards its target, snaps the value
when its integer distance is zero, wraps the room blink counter at 100,
increases `DngTreeMapActiveLightRate` by 0.05 up to 1, and clears the
queued mark count before the next draw.

`MakeDngTreeMapJumpNo` maps the first floor of each dungeon through
`name_tbl_2728`. It has special transitions from dungeon 0 floor 8 to
`s01`, dungeon 1 floor 6 to `s05`, and dungeon 3 floor 20 to `d04b01`;
the latter can instead select loop 2 when story flag `0x1B6` is set and
`0x1BC` is clear. The first floor of dungeon 6 also sets the main scene's
map to `d07f01`.

`DrawTreeMap` first draws a shrinking highlight around the selected cell
in menu mode. It then visits every grid cell: rooms go through
`DrawRoomOne`, with a half-bright interval during their blink cycle, and
passages go through `DrawRoot` twice, once for each layer. The outgoing
marks come from `DrawGlidCheck`.

`DngTreeMapKey` steps the tree map in map mode. When that step opens the
save screen, it saves map information, sets loop number 2, and gives the
save menu the unused portion of `MenuTreeMapStack` plus the tree menu's
fourth texture block. When the save screen closes, it clears the save
flag, resumes map mode, starts a forty-frame fade and resets the tree
menu to mode 12, step 1 before rebuilding its messages.
Evaluating `stGetRest` before `stGetTop` gives the retail load order for
the stack buffer arguments. The C++ function passes full-image verification.

`__sinit_dngmenu_cpp` sets the initial source rectangles for the map's
light circle, number glyphs, root placement and floor information frame,
then initializes `MenuTreeMapStack`.

`CMenuTreeMap::MsgInit` attaches `systree.mes` to all eight message windows,
applies preset 15, enables zero values, and configures the command
analyzer's menu and system message buffers. Its `MSG_INIT` script sets up
the shared message window. That window begins with message 300 and appends
message 81 or 80 for the two special opening modes, then places two lines
near the screen bottom. The second line moves to x=600 while the save
screen is inactive.

`DrawRoot` draws passage shapes 0 through 9 as three parallel line strips
or pairs of strips. Its first call is the shadow layer, shifted eight
pixels down and right and drawn at five percent alpha; its second call is
the coloured layer. Menu mode uses a warm tint, while event mode uses a
darker red. Opened passage types with `show_mark` draw a 22 by 22 mark from
`root_type_texturecrd_1216`, positioned with `markOffsetTable_1092` (or
`zerumaito_offset_1110` for shape 0 in dungeon 6).

`DrawRoomOne` chooses a room picture from `dt` according to its visited
state, texture number, and start/exit/boss/sub flags. Dungeon numbers 4–6
use a slightly larger destination rectangle. It draws a shadow in menu
mode, dims rooms other than the player's in event mode, advances each
room's mark phase by the mode-specific value in `stepCntTbl_1501`, and
queues the bobbing mark rectangle. An unvisited room receives a small
overlay unless it is the player's room. Visited rooms can display up to
three glyphs from `dtname`, chosen by the room flags.

`DrawGeoramaMateria` draws a page of up to fourteen georama item names in
two columns, using `GeoramaMateriaInfoDrawPage` for the starting item and
`GeoramaMateriaNum` for the end. It reloads the floor information texture
for the frame, reloads the message texture for the names, then displays
the page count in the lower right.

`DngTreeMapInit` reserves a work buffer from the remaining menu stack,
constructs the tree menu and floor map inside it, loads the floor grid when
the opening mode requires it, and reads the menu's data list. It sets each
of the eight message windows to use the system message buffer and gives
the second window the digit font. The menu cursor texture file is
`frametex.img`.

`CMenuTreeMap::InitEnd` loads the dungeon map picture and floor information
texture, chooses a room from saved progress (or the marked boss/sub room),
centres the map on it, starts the opening fade, and loads `systree.mes`.
It then reads the dungeon treasure script into an aligned buffer and
builds the treasure tables if that read succeeds.

`CMenuTreeMap::Draw` draws the floor map and, when enabled, the shared help
message. It draws the selected floor's information and medals, eases the
cursor towards that room, and draws the cursor or money board. During the
save transition it animates the second help line and its colour.

`CDngFreeMap::Draw` skips inactive or fully transparent maps and maps
without a texture. It clamps opacity to 0–128, reloads `dt`, draws the
backdrop, whole-screen overlay, cells and player piece, then composites
queued room marks with `dtname` outside event mode. With
`menu_debug_flag` set it additionally draws a diagnostic panel for the
selected room, including its links, visit count and eight save flags.

Unit: dungeon floor map (`CDngFreeMap`) and the dungeon menu's tree map (`CMenuTreeMap`).
No first-game counterpart (Dark Cloud 1 has no class of either name; nothing equivalent found
in `/home/adubbz/development/chronicle/ps2/include`).

## Header dependencies
- `CMenuTreeMap : CBaseMenuClass` -> `menusys.hpp` (did not exist when this header was written).
- `CDC2Mes mes[8]` by value -> `menucls1.hpp` (exists; asserts `sizeof(CDC2Mes) == 0x2A50`).
- `TRESURE_BOX_FLOOR_INFO tresure` by value -> `dng_event.hpp` (did not exist). Its size must be
  0x1A40C: `AutoSetTreasureBox` (dng_event) does `__nw(0x1A40C)` for one.
- Forward-declared only: `GLID_INFO`, `DNGMAP_ROOM_INFO`, `DNGMAP_ROOT_INFO` (dngfloor owns
  them: `CDngFloorManager` returns/takes `GLID_INFO*`), `CDngFloorManager`, `CSaveDataDungeon`,
  `mgCMemory`, `mgCTexture`.
- The header was verified to compile, and `dngmenu.cpp` to compile with it, against stub
  versions of the three missing types with the sizes above (CBaseMenuClass 0x110 with its
  vptr at 0x10C).

## CDngFreeMap (size 0x110)
Size: `DngTreeMapInit` `__nw(0x110)`; symbol `EventDngMap` (event_func) size 0x110.
Constructor is inline (emitted in `DngTreeMapInit` and `__sinit_event_func_cpp`): it calls
`mgRect<float>::Set(0,0,0,0)` on the rect at 0x20 and on each of the 8 rects at 0x40, then
`Initialize()`. That means `mgRect<T>` has a default constructor `{ Set(0,0,0,0); }` (and the
globals in `__sinit_dngmenu_cpp` show a 4-argument constructor calling `Set`). `mgRect` lives in
`mg_tanime.hpp` with no constructors; they have to be added there before the constructor matches.
`mgRect<float>::Set` (0x1F3D50) is emitted in this unit and comes from that template.

`DNGMAP_KOMA_POS` is an invented name (no retail symbol): `{float x, y; next}` nodes allocated
with `mgCMemory::Alloc(1)` (one 16-byte unit; only 0xC used). Built from
`RootHokanTable*` (20 s16 x/y pairs each) and `RoomHokanTable*`
(10 pairs each) offsets in LoadDngInfo.

Not a virtual class (no vtable symbol, no vptr store).

## CMenuTreeMap (size 0x2FBE0)
Size: `DngTreeMapInit` `__nw(0x2FBE0)` (after `Alloc(0x2FC0)` units). Base `CBaseMenuClass` is
0x110 (its ctor does `memset(this, 0, 0x110)`, vptr at 0x10C). Constructor inline in
`DngTreeMapInit`: base ctor, vptr = `__vt__12CMenuTreeMap`, 8x `CDC2Mes` ctor, then
0x11A=0, 0x120=0, 0x153B0=0, base 0x14=0, 0x153C0=1, 0x153B8=0, 0x153BC=0, 0x153C4=0, then
for i<8: `MenuDngMes[i] = &mes[i]; ClsMes::Init(); SetBuff_system(GetSystemMesBuffer())`, then
`MenuDngMes[1]+0x224C = 0x10`. `MenuDngMes` is a file-local static, so the constructor body has
to be defined in dngmenu.cpp (declared only in the header).

Vtable `__vt__12CMenuTreeMap` (0x37BF70, 0x20): `0, 0, IsCreateObject, IsMakeObject,
IsAskExtend, ItemCmdAfter, InitEnd (CMenuTreeMap), ExitEnd` -- all but InitEnd are
`CBaseMenuClass`'s, emitted here as weak inline copies (IsCreateObject returns 1, the other
three return 0, ExitEnd empty). Step calls InitEnd through the vtable at +0x18.

`*(s16*)this` (base) is the menu state: 0 running, 1 opening (calls InitEnd when the fade and
BG read finish), 2 closing, 0xC returning from the save menu. Base 0x14 is the sub-screen
(0 map, 1 floor info, 2 georama list); base 0x2 is a sub-state used with 0xC.

## Enums
- `DNGMAP_MODE` (CDngFreeMap::mode): 0 menu, 1 event (see above).
- `DNGMAP_FADE`: -1/0/1 (Initialize, FadeIn, FadeOut).
- `DNG_TREE_MAP_RESULT`: CMenuTreeMap::Step returns 2 when `DAT_01efc64c == 5` (jump chosen),
  1 otherwise on close, 0 while open; DngTreeMapKey passes it through; menumap's WorldMoveKey
  tests 1 and 2.
- `DNG_TREE_MODE`: `DngTreeMode` static, 0 tree map, 1 save menu (DngTreeMapKey/Draw).
- `CheckDngTreeMapFuncType` gives 2 when `MenuCommonInfo+0x50 == 3` (menumain opens the tree
  map with mode 3 from a save point, setting TreeMapSaveFlag), 1 when it is 1 or
  `TreeMapCallDungeonSubMap`, else 0. No enum: the meaning of mode 1 is not established.

## Globals
Only four of the unit's data symbols are global (others are LOCAL in retail, so `static` in the
.cpp): `TreeMapSaveFlag` (u8, lbu), `TreeMapSaveNum` (s16, lh; menuop increments per save),
`TreeMapCallDungeonSubMap` (u8; menumain SetCommonMenuModeID), `TreeMapCalledWorldMap` (u8;
menumap). Statics of note: `MenuDngMap` (CDngFreeMap*), `CMenuTreePt` (CMenuTreeMap*),
`MenuDngMes` (CDC2Mes*[8]), `MenuTreeMapStack` (mgCMemory, 0x30), `treemap_root_put`
(mgRect<float>), `Floor_Info`, `dng_light_circle`, `dngfreemap_num` (mgRect<int>),
`dng_player_pos` (float[2]), `Floor_InfoTex` (mgCTexture*, "dngfibrd"), `DngTreeMode` (s16),
`GeoramaMateriaNum` (s16), `DngInfoStageNo` (u8).

## Non-members
`CheckGeoramaMateria`, `DrawDngRoomInfo`, `DrawGeoramaMateria` are LOCAL in retail -> static in
the .cpp, not in the header. `ClsMes::Init` (0x1F38E0) belongs to this unit and is
currently supplied by `INCLUDE_ASM`; its C++ declaration is in `nd_meswin.hpp`.

## GLID_INFO / DNGMAP_ROOM_INFO as seen from here (for dngfloor's header)
GLID_INFO stride 0x70 (CDngFloorManager +4 array, +8 count, +0xC/+0xE grid width/height):
+0 s16 kind (0 passage, 1 room), +2 s16 grid x, +4 s16 grid y, +0xC GLID_INFO*[4] neighbours,
+0x1C u8 blink, +0x20 DNGMAP_ROOM_INFO / DNGMAP_ROOT_INFO. Room info (relative to +0x20):
+4 char* georama list, +8 s8 floor id, +0xC u32 flags (2 entrance, 4, 8, 0x10 special floors),
+0x18 s16 message no, +0x3E/+0x40 s16 draw offset, +0x42 s8 picture, +0x45 u8 (cleared/visited;
also read as glid+0x65 in DrawGlidCheck), +0x46 u8 mark (bobbing mark, glid+0x66 in InitEnd),
+0x48 float mark phase (DrawRoomOne).

`LoadDngInfo` uses the unused portion of its caller's stack for a temporary
arena. It loads `dmap%d.img` into the assigned texture block with the `_dn`
suffix, then positions the board at the current room. When an event has a
next room, dungeon-specific branch rules reduce jumps to a nearby room. The
function creates a linked path of piece positions: ten interpolation points
for the destination room, twenty for each intervening passage cell, and ten
for any intervening room. Direction and passage shape select the point table
and whether it is read forward or backward. The first path node is the
piece's starting point; subsequent nodes drive event movement. The returned
value is the number of quadwords consumed from the temporary arena.

`CMenuTreeMap::Step` handles cursor navigation, floor detail messages,
confirmation of travel to a floor, the save-menu handoff, and debug controls.
Its persistent static state records the previous direction and selected
cell so movement can distinguish a held key from a new selection.

`DrawDngRoomInfo` draws the floor detail panel only when a room and its
texture are available. Its height varies with the language and whether the
floor has a geostone, spheda challenge or fishing test. The panel fades in
six alpha units per frame and out eight. It draws the border and seal pulse,
then places four challenge rows and their message windows; the medal message
uses a language-specific position.

The medal overlay's UV coordinates in `DrawDngRoomInfo` remain uncertain:
retail copies packed words from `medal_xytbl_1736` into rectangle locals.
The current draft uses the existing highlight rectangle for that overlay,
so its placement needs further work during matching.

`mgRect<float>::Set` stores its four arguments directly into the left, top,
right and bottom fields. The explicit float specialization is a separate
retail symbol from the generic template, emitted by a native specialization.

retail symbol from the generic template. MWCC initially names its symbol
`Set__9mgRect<f>Fffff`; the object postprocessor normalizes that name to
retail's `Set__9mgRect_f_Fffff`. A candidate that leaves the assembly marker
in the disabled branch fails mwccgap's raw-name lookup; removing the guard
and marker makes the native specialization pass the full linked-image check.

`SetUserGlid` clears the selected player cell and looks up a room only when
its number is nonnegative. Writing the comparison as `0 <= room_no` gives
retail's `slt at` and matches the linked image. `DeleteTexBlock` releases a
nonnegative texture block through the texture manager. Binding the manager
before the sign test places its address setup in retail's branch delay slot;
that native function also matches the linked image.

## Native static initialization

The light-circle and free-map number rectangles are zero-filled 0x10-byte data globals whose four-argument constructors call `mgRect<int>::Set`. The root placement rectangle uses the default `mgRect<float>` constructor; the floor-information rectangle uses four arguments. A native `mgCMemory MenuTreeMapStack` completes the same initialization order. Together these globals emit the 144-byte retail `__sinit_dngmenu_cpp` exactly and retain the original data/BSS section assignments after object postprocessing. This replaces the guarded handwritten initializer and assembly fallback.

## Small floor-map functions: native assessment

The m2c output confirms the existing drafts for `SetUserGlid`,
`CalcGlidPutPos`, `SetTextureInfo`, `FadeIn`, `FadeOut`, `DeleteTexBlock`,
and `Initialize`. Dependencies are already typed and documented:
`CDngFreeMap` is 0x110 bytes, `GLID_INFO` grid coordinates are signed
16-bit fields at offsets 2 and 4, and the texture block is signed 16-bit
at 0xD0. Texture manager lookup takes a name and block number; deletion
takes the sign-extended block. Fade duration and state are 32-bit integers
with float alpha and step. Grid projection uses signed integer arithmetic
before conversion to float; its null case leaves both output references
unchanged. Initialization writes the Y scroll before X, X target before
Y target, and current path pointer before path head.

`mgRect<float>::Set` has four scalar float stores, confirmed by m2c. Its
native specialization is assessed alongside the small functions because
the assembly fallback coexists with an implicitly instantiated template
body and creates an unnamed extra text section in the baseline object.

### Canonical native result

All eight assessed functions have zero byte and resolved-relocation
differences: `Initialize`, `SetUserGlid`, `CalcGlidPutPos`, `SetTextureInfo`,
`FadeIn`, `FadeOut`, `DeleteTexBlock`, and `mgRect<float>::Set`. The entire
isolated wrapper object passes the canonical comparator (0x8C30 compared
bytes and 1097 relocations). The assembly fallback for the float rectangle
specialization creates an anonymous extra text section in the prior
object, preventing text comparison; the native specialization resolves
that section issue and the associated unresolved targets.

Initialization requires the binary32 286.0 value (`0x438f0000`) in
`Initialize__11CDngFreeMapFv` to evaluate first. This is an unscoped stable
Satan's Fiddle identity. It restores the early f15 load without changing
the rectangle arguments. Separate assignments preserve the target-scroll
and path-pointer store order.

MWCC emits retail's `slt` plus branch when the comparison operands are
written `0 <= room_no` and `0 < frames`; writing the variable first emits
the dedicated signed-zero branch. Grid X projection adds the negative
row contribution (`x * 52 + y * -16`), preserving retail's negation
before the shift. Texture deletion binds the manager before testing the
block number so the manager address is available at the retail branch.

## Scroll targeting and final overlay

`SetNextRoomPos` projects the requested grid cell, converts X then Y to
integer with the runtime conversion helper, and adds the clipping
displacement to the current scroll. Dependencies and float reference
outputs are already documented. `ResetDngMapPos` additionally walks every
cell and projects cells on each outer grid boundary before projecting the
selected room. These boundary results are unused, but the calls remain
in retail. The boundary coordinates are the signed `glid_w` and `glid_h`
fields of `CDngFloorManager`; cells have a 0x70-byte stride.
`DrawLast` skips absent textures and event mode, then draws the 128 by
128 source texture over the full screen using the menu primitive.

`DrawDngName` uses an integer source rectangle and two by-value `PrimQuad`
calls. Its shadow alpha converts one quarter of the integer opacity to
integer through the runtime float conversion helper. `DrawBackPattern`
converts opacity to float before testing against zero, and returns without
drawing when event mode has negative opacity. Both routines use the
existing documented `mgCDrawPrim` and `mgRect<int>` interfaces.

`DngTreeMapDraw` reads `DngTreeMode` with a signed-halfword load, rather
than the byte type in the guarded draft. Its source declaration is signed
16-bit; the existing four-byte BSS reservation includes alignment padding.
`CheckDngTreeMapFuncType` reads the documented signed-halfword opening
mode and unsigned-byte sub-map flag. Both dispatch helpers have complete
existing dependency interfaces.

`SetNextRoomPos`, `ResetDngMapPos`, `DrawLast`, `DrawDngName`, and
`DrawBackPattern` pass the canonical comparator as native bodies with the
shared profile. The complete unit passes (0x8C10 bytes, 1101 relocations).
`ResetDngMapPos` uses a two-element float array for the selected room's
projection and int locals for sign-extended grid dimensions. Negative
event opacity returns from `DrawBackPattern` immediately.

`Step` converts each scroll delta to integer, calls the integer runtime
`abs`, then converts that result to float for comparison with 1.0. The
float comparison, rather than an integer comparison, is present in retail.
Its selection-brightness global is a float. The fade and grid-scroll
fields and runtime `abs(int)` interface are already typed and documented.

`FadeInOutMenu` tests the signed-halfword field `draw_hidden` at offset 0x11A
before checking the closing fade. The m2c type mapping incorrectly labels
this read as the second message window's text offset; the actual retail
load resolves the ambiguity. Both opening and closing
menu state values are already documented by the base menu interface.
`DrawGlid` draws a red outline with a by-value float rectangle: the lower
edge is offset 20 down and 16 left, and the alpha converts to integer.

`DrawGlidCheck` uses the four typed neighbour pointers, grid coordinate
fields, room flags and visited byte already documented by `dngfloor`.
The sub-floor and boss-floor flags are tested separately in retail before
checking the visited byte. The returned bits encode adjoining room edges
and directional visited-floor marks.

`CheckDngTreeMapFuncType`, `DngTreeMapDraw`, `Step`, `DrawGlid`, and
`FadeInOutMenu` also have zero canonical differences as native bodies.
`DrawGlid` keeps named upper/right/lower coordinates live through the
outline calls, reproducing retail's three preserved float registers.

Viewport clipping retains its guarded draft: four instructions differ,
consisting of two exchanged coordinate initializations and a subtraction
scheduled into a branch delay slot. The earlier `DrawGlidCheck` candidate omitted a duplicate zero return assignment on the null path; master resolves this by initializing the mark mask after the null check, and that native implementation is retained in the merge.

## Tree map drawing assessment

`DrawTreeMap` retains the initial grid-table pointer across the highlight
rendering calls and advances it by whole typed cells. The cell kind is
loaded after `DrawGlidCheck`, and the blink flag is read as signed byte.
The m2c output moves this load before the call; the actual disassembly
establishes its position.
The highlight starts at `(x - 8 - 30, -42 + 11 + y)` and contracts using
`62 - 62 * rate` and `40 - 40 * rate`; these expressions retain the
retail floating-point rounding sequence. The cell rectangle is constructed
directly with `(0, 0, 52, 20)`, rather than constructed with zero edges
and then reset. Existing grid, rectangle, primitive and drawing interfaces
cover all dependencies.

The improved `DrawTreeMap` candidate was saved outside the checkout; the original guarded draft is retained in source. The candidate's
remaining canonical differences are the exchanged loop-index and mark
register assignments (s19 versus s20); every other instruction and all
resolved relocations agree. The private 52.0 evaluate-first trial did not
improve this difference and no profile row is accepted.

## Combined native merge checkpoint

The merge preserves all eighteen locally validated promotions and master's additional native `DrawGlidCheck` and `DngTreeMapKey` implementations. Master's typed names `draw_hidden` and `battle_clear` are retained. These combined sources require integrated verification after the shared header and tool conflicts are resolved. No new calibration rows were introduced during resolution.

## Native jump destination selection

`MakeDngTreeMapJumpNo` selects special event destinations and otherwise uses
the dungeon's first-floor name. For dungeon six, retail gets the current scene
before looking up `d07f01`; retaining the scene in a typed local preserves this
nested-call order. The combined dngmenu unit passes its canonical check
with this native body:0x8BE0 bytes,1119 resolved relocations. No selector changes
are needed.

`DrawPlayer` projects into separate scalar coordinates, applies its four-pixel
and thirty-pixel adjustments, then converts opacity to float. The later Color
argument converts it back to integer, as retail does. A direct texture-rectangle
constructor avoids an unnecessary default initialization. Together with the
jump helper, the complete unit passes:0x8BD4 bytes,1129 relocations.
No new floating selectors are required; initial 4/30 selector trials were
ineffective and discarded.

## Native message-window initialization

`ClsMes::Init` is emitted from its shared C++ definition in `nd_meswin.hpp`.
This unit selects `MES_WINDOW_OUT_OF_LINE_INIT`; other callers retain the
inline body. Moving the initializer entirely out of the header changes caller
code and fails retail verification. The shared definition with scoped emission
preserves those callers and passes the full linked retail comparison.
