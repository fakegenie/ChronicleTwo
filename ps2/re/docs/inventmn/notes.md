# inventmn: reverse-engineering notes

## Linked text length

The native drafts of `CMenuInvent::LoadCharaCheck`, `CMenuInvent::IsCreateObject`,
and `MenuInventInit` compile to 0x48C, 0x1568, and 0x1018 bytes, respectively;
retail uses 0x4D8, 0x1588, and 0x1048. Their shorter code shifts the following
linked text by 0xA0 after function alignment. These drafts remain guarded by
`NONMATCHING` and the matching build uses their retail assembly.
`UpdataNetaMemoStr` is now active C++; its 404-byte body and resolved
relocations pass the canonical object comparison.

The matching build also selects retail gaps for `ResetAddress`, `CalcTex`,
`IsAccessAlbum`, and `MenuInventKey`; those functions have guarded C++ drafts.
The other invention-menu functions remain native C++ where already matched.

Invention menu ("Invent"): camera photos, ideas ("neta", id < 1000) and scoops (id >= 1000),
the memory-card album, invention recipes and the menu page class. No first-game counterpart
(Dark Cloud 1 has no camera/invention system).

## Header dependencies
`inventmn.hpp` includes, for by-value types:
- `menusys.hpp`   -> `CBaseMenuClass` (base of `CMenuInvent`; size 0x110, vptr at 0x10C,
  `__vt__14CBaseMenuClass` has the same six slots).
- `userdata.hpp`  -> `CGameDataUsed` (member at 0x168; size 0x6C from `MenuUserParam` stride 0x6C
  in `SearchNowPosItemExist` and the 0x1D4 next field).
- `memcard.hpp`   -> `MC_ICON_DATA` (array of 3 at 0x1D4; 0x28 each, `SetIconData` memcpys 3x0x28).
- `menudraw.hpp`  -> `MENUFORM_MAKEBRD_INFO` (0x2C, `Init_MENUFORM_MAKEBRD_INFO` memsets 0x2C).
`CInventUserData`, `CScoopDataManager`, `USER_PICTURE_INFO`, `INVENT_CREATED_ITEM` and `SCOOP_INFO` are
declared in `userdata.hpp` (functions still here): CUserDataManager holds CInventUserData by value and
this header needs userdata/menusys/memcard, so keeping them here made an include cycle. All includes are
now at the top. Header order (acyclic, each includes only what it needs by value): gamedata < userdata < menusys < savedata < memcard < inventmn.
`CInventUserData() { Initialize(); }` is the inline constructor CUserDataManager's constructor runs.

## Globals
Every data symbol of the unit is LOCAL in retail (`local_symbols.tsv`), so the header has no
`extern`s; declare them `static` in the `.cpp`. What they are:
- `InventUserDataPtr` CInventUserData*, `InventAlbumPtr` CDC2AlbumData*, `InventManagePt`
  CInventDataManage* (points at `InventManageMan`, a CInventDataManage, 8 bytes),
  `MCManagerPtr` CMemoryCardManager*, `CMenuInventPt` CMenuInvent*.
- `pict_seiton_case` s8: sort key PictureSeiton uses next (0 neta_id, 1 map_no, 2 npc_no,
  3 monster_no), cycles 0..3.
- `scoop_table` SCOOP_DATA[53] (.data 0x424). `menu_scoop_str_tag` SPI_TAG_PARAM[2] ("STR"),
  `pic_tag` SPI_TAG_PARAM[3] (PIC_INFO, PIC_NAME), `invent_teigi_func` SPI_TAG_PARAM[3]
  (DATATABLESET, DATASET); each list ends with a null entry.
- `scoop_str_stack`, `PicNameStack` mgCMemory*; `pic_name_info_top` PIC_NAME_INFO*,
  `pic_name_info_num`, `pic_name_info_num_count` short (size 2). Entries with neta_id 30000
  are dropped from the count.
- `inventSpiDataTblTop` INVENT_DATA_INFO* (write cursor during DATASET), `invent_num_counter`
  short. `InventTeigiStack` mgCMemory (recipe memory). `MenuInventStack`,
  `MenuInventCharaStack`, `MenuInventMCStack` mgCMemory (initialised by `__sinit`).
- `NetaMemoStr` 0x800, `NetaMemoID` short[0x200], `NetaMemoStrNum` short: idea-notebook lines.
- `InventInNetaEffect` CStarDust* (array from `__construct_new_array(.., 0xC, n)`),
  `InventInNetaEffectFlag`/`Num` s8, `InventInNetaEffectNum4` short.
- `Tex_Hatsumei` mgCTexture* (invention memo texture), `InventSubDataReadBGInfo`,
  `rec_board_offset_xtbl` int[10], `invent_color_tbl` u8 RGBA rows used by Gradation*,
  `invent_grade_fff` (.sdata 8 bytes), `debug_invent_*` debug state,
  `menu_invent_command_info_*` command-window state.
- Strings (Shift-JIS) are useful: forms "inv_bg","itembrd","ネタ板","makebrd","カードリスト",
  "cardlist","Album_sw","Album_Big","neta0..2","neta0name..2","recbrd","poly_chr0/1",
  "invent_okeff","DLOAD","kakudai_pic"/"pic"; scripts "MSG考察モード","NextToThink",
  "MSG発明製作モード","NextToCardList","NextToAlbumView","NextToPhotoView","picmodeonly",
  "ALBUM_OFF","FORMSWAP0/1","INIT_END"; files "inv_bg.img","edmenu.img","invent.cfg",
  "inv_com.cfg","inv6.lst","menu/inv6.lst","neta2.lst"; "neta%d" texture names.

## Local (static) functions
_SCOOP_STR, _PIC_INFO, _PIC_NAME, CheckPhotoFlag, _INVENT_DATATABLESET, _INVENT_DATASET,
neta_sort, MakeMsgNetaName, PictureMemoOne, MenuInventDebugKey, MenuInventDebugDraw,
MenuInventPushKey. Not in the header. Signatures: SPI tags `int f(SPI_STACK *, int)`;
`int CheckPhotoFlag()`; `int neta_sort(int,int,int,int*)`;
`void MakeMsgNetaName(CDC2Mes*, CMenuPosDataForm*, USER_PICTURE_INFO*, int*, int)`;
`void PictureMemoOne(float,float,int)`; `int MenuInventDebugKey()`; `void MenuInventDebugDraw()`;
`int MenuInventPushKey(int,int)`.

## USER_PICTURE_INFO (0x18; stride in every photo array)
0 u8 used; 1 u8 is_new (PhotoCheckEnd clears; DrawTakePhoto sets 0/1 both to 1);
2 map_no (SearchMapNo in DngMainDraw; GetMapTitle); 4 npc_no (GetNPCName; 0x104 special);
6 monster_no (GetMonsterName); 8 s16 never read meaningfully (init/copy -1);
A neta_id (<=0 none, <1000 idea, >=1000 scoop); C..13 never touched except by memcpy;
14 pixel pointer (copied to mgCTexture::image[0], a u_long128*; PictureSeiton takes the base
as char*, so typed char*; cast when assigning). Init sets 0,0,-1,-1,-1(8),-1(6),0.

The compiled `Init_USER_PICTURE_INFO` stores these seven fields separately and leaves the
pixel pointer and unused bytes alone. `CDC2AlbumData::DeletePhotoData` accepts slots 0..49
and clears their metadata through this initializer. `CInventUserData::AddShutterNum`
clamps the running shutter count to 0..99999. `CScoopDataManager::SetViewFlag` changes
the first byte (`known`) only when `GetScoopInfo` finds the requested scoop.

## CInventUserData (save data + 0x251D0; CUserDataManager + 0x7F30)
0 shutter_num (AddShutterNum clamps 0..99999); 4 level (= CalcPhotoExp/100; GetLevel +1);
8 short neta_id[0x200]; 0x408 USER_PICTURE_INFO photo[30]; 0x6D8 INVENT_CREATED_ITEM[0x100]
(Initialize zeroes both shorts; only item_id is read); 0xAD8 CScoopDataManager
(`ScoopMan` = savedata + 0x25CA8, CShopMenu passes userdata + 0x8A08); 0xCD8..0xD60 unseen;
0xD60 photo_work[30][0x2000] (Initialize memsets 0x3C000).
0x3CD60..0x3CE60 unseen (unk_3cd60). Size 0x3CE60 is inferred from the containing
CUserDataManager: its next field (party_member) is at 0x44D90 = 0x7F30 + 0x3CE60 and nothing
there touches the 0x100 bytes in between; no inventmn code reaches past 0x3CD60.
CScoopDataManager: SCOOP_INFO[0x80] (index <= 0x7F, total loop 0x80); size not asserted
(the 0x88 bytes after it may belong to it).
TranslateInventUserData: source (older save, buffer + 0x25250) has 12-byte created-item
records; copies the first two shorts of each of 128 into 4-byte records of the destination.
Called from CMemoryCardManager::LoadFromMc when the version string matches an older one.
Photographed-ideas list lives in CUserDataManager + 0x44DD0 (short[0x200]), not here.

## CDC2AlbumData (0x64CB0: Initialize memset, GetSaveDataSize)
0 char photo_work[50][0x2000]; 0x64000 USER_PICTURE_INFO[50]; 0x644B0..0x64CB0 unseen.

## SCOOP_DATA (0x14; table 53 rows)
0 scoop_id, 2 flag_no (CheckBitFlagMenu), 4 s8 info_no (CScoopDataManager index), 8 char* text
(set by STR tag), C and 10 zeroed by InitScoopString, never read here.

## CInventDataManage (8; InventManageMan size 8)
0 short num; 4 INVENT_DATA_INFO* table. Constructed by hand on the stack in CheckInventItem
and CheckItemTable (no constructor).
INVENT_DATA_INFO (0x24, stride in GetInventDataInfoByItemID): 0 item_id (-1 unset), 2 neta[3],
8 INVENT_MATERIAL*, C material_num ((argc-9)/2), 10 short read from DATASET, 14/18/1C model
position (passed to the created model's vfunc 0x14), 20 scale (CMenuInvent 0x5E8).
DATASET float order: arg -> 0x20, then 0x14, 0x18, 0x1C.
INVENT_MATERIAL (4): short item_id, u8 num.
HowMuchZairyouMakeItem result: int count, then {int item, int need}[4].
CheckInventEnable returns item_id or -1 (short), sets *near_match when >= 2 ideas match.
Struct names INVENT_DATA_INFO, INVENT_MATERIAL, INVENT_CREATED_ITEM, SCOOP_DATA, SCOOP_INFO,
PIC_NAME_INFO are not retail (no symbol); chosen from the accessor names.

## CMenuInvent (0xF30, operator new 0xF30 in MenuInventInit; base CBaseMenuClass)
Constructor is inline (MenuInventInit): CBaseMenuClass ctor, vptr = __vt__11CMenuInvent at
0x10C, CGameDataUsed ctor at 0x168, mgCMemory::Init at 0x398/0x53C/0xD48, field inits.
Vtable order (= base): IsCreateObject(int,int), IsMakeObject(int,int), IsAskExtend(int,int),
ItemCmdAfter(int, ITEMCMD_RET_PARA*), InitEnd(), ExitEnd(). The int virtuals return int.
Mode is the base's short at 0x14 (INVENT_MENU_MODE). 0, 2, 5, 6 named from the scripts run in
PrepareNextMode; 3 from SearchNowPosItemExist (MenuUserParam items) / NextDifferentMode;
4 and 8 also occur (NextDifferentMode) but their page is not established.
Offsets:
- 0x110 photo_only (=1 when MenuCommonInfo+0x50 == 10; runs "picmodeonly"), 0x112 short.
- 0x114/118 card cursor/top, 0x11C/120 item, 0x124/128 photo, 0x12C/130 album, 0x134/138 notebook
  (ExitEnd stores all ten and 0x392 into CMenuSystemData 0x20..0x3E).
- 0x13C MENUFORM_MAKEBRD_INFO (CalcMakeBrd, CalcCommonBrdDrawInfo).
- 0x1D4 MC_ICON_DATA[3] (names strcpy'd from at_5011..5013; GetPackFile fills data/size).
- 0x258 album_enable (GetNumSameItem(0x165) > 0; "ALBUM_OFF" otherwise).
- 0x25C/0x260 photo board scroll / scroll bar (CalcTex), 0x264 float[30][2] slot positions
  (x = (i&1)*0x58+8, y = (i/2)*0x36+0x68), 0x358 notebook scroll.
- 0x370 float[4] zero vector, 0x380.. 128.0 x3, 0x394 u_int* sound data for MenuSePlay.
- 0x398 mgCMemory (MenuDataAnalyze), 0x3C8 mgCTexture*[30], 0x440 mgCTexture*[50] (AttachPictTex),
  0x508 s8[50] album flags (-1 empty).
- 0x53C mgCMemory chara memory (0x558/0x560 written as mgCMemory fields in LoadCharaCheck).
- 0x574 CActionChara* model of built item, 0x57C = &recipe->material, 0x580 build stage,
  0x582 built item id, 0x5E4..0x5F0 floats of the bob animation (0x5E8 scale).
- 0x60C neta_select_num, 0x610 int[3] index, 0x61C s8[3] type (0 photo, 1 notebook), 0x61F s8[3],
  0x622 s8[3]; 0x628 = 40.0.
- 0x630 MENU_BGREAD_INFO-like pointer (GetReadBGInfo), 0x634 load stage (0,1,2,-1),
  0x638 CActionChara* (built in LoadCharaCheck), 0x63C CActionChara*, 0x648 = -0.628.
- 0x650..0x68C floats set in MenuInventInit; 0x670/0x680 two float[4].
- 0x690 int[50][2]: `menu_randam_line_draw_postbl` points here (GenarateRandamLine writes 50
  points). 0x820..0xD48 no access found.
- 0xD48 mgCMemory (IsCreateObject), 0xD78/0xD7C ints (album memory-card progress).
- 0xEAC gradation mode, 0xEB0 int, 0xEB4..0xEB6 flags.
- `GradationStep` advances the two success-flash strips by four pixels in mode 1. In mode 3 it
  moves the first three effect parameters of both strips by two toward the colour table row for
  `create_step`, alternating the row for the second effect. The draft uses `MENU_PARTS_EFFECT_STRUCT1`
  and remains under the retail assembly fallback.
- `CalcCursorPosition` selects cursor coordinates by the active layout (`key_arg_no`), including
  the idea board, card and photo lists, item board, album and notebook. It takes frame dimensions
  and offsets from the menu layout table, hides the frame for special `photo_only` states, and
  can snap the cursor to its new position via `cursor_snap`. Its draft compiles but does not yet match.
- 0xEB8..0xF28 forms/parts from AttachFormInfo (see header); 0xEFC, 0xF0C, 0xF2C not touched.
  Part pointers (GetPartInfo results) typed void* pending menudraw's part type.

## CStarDust
Owned by menudraw; its inline constructor (`this[10] = 0`) is emitted in inventmn at 0x2082C0
for `__construct_new_array` in PhotoNetaEnter. Size 0xC.

## Typed access and code generation
- `GetInventUserDataPtr` reaches the embedded invention data through the existing
  `CSaveData::GetUserDataManager()` and `CUserDataManager::GetInventUserData()` accessors.
  MWCC inlines both and retains the retail two-addition address calculation; a single
  nested field expression combines the offsets and changes the object code.
- `CDC2AlbumData::RelateAlbumPicData`, `GetPhotoName`, and
  `CMenuInvent::GetNowSelectNetaID` accept typed photo-array access without changing
  their retail instructions. The latter keeps a named typed photo pointer so MWCC
  emits the retail operand order for the final address addition.
- `CMenuInvent::InitNetaCircle` uses `neta_select_index`, `neta_form`, and
  `neta_name_form` arrays for its three slots; typed indexing matches retail.
- `HowMuchZairyouMakeItem` has an `int *` output parameter in its retail ABI,
  but the pointed-to storage is `MakeItemNeeds`. A single cast to that record
  lets the function index its material and output arrays directly; the typed
  implementation remains a complete match.
- `CountNeta`, `CountScoop`, `CalcPhotoExp`, and `LevelCheck` scan or update
  `CUserDataManager::photo_subject[0x200]`. Typed short-array indexing preserves
  each function's retail instructions and removes the integer pointer casts.
- `USER_PICTURE_INFO::used` is a signed byte in retail. Declaring it `s8`
  removes the signed-byte pointer casts in photo paths without changing the
  matched functions; `SCOOP_INFO::known` and `obtained` were already signed bytes.
- `CMenuInvent::EnterDataMenu` loads the three `MC_ICON_DATA` records through
  their `name`, `data`, and `size` fields. Typed field access preserves retail.
- `PrepareNextMode` uses `CMenuKeyFunc::cursor_form` at offset 0x138; typed
  field access preserves retail. `MenuInventNetaMemoDraw` uses `memo_bar`,
  `NetaMemoStr[i]`, and `NetaMemoID[i]`; `MenuInventAlbumPictureDraw` uses
  `album_tex[i]`, `album_scroll_x`, and successive `USER_PICTURE_INFO` records.
  Both drawing functions remain complete matches.
- `GradationSet` reads two grade-part names from `invent_grade_fff`. Typed
  indexing converts the byte-offset loop to an element index, changing a
  shift and the loop increment; the typed version currently scores 99.096%.
- `UpdataNetaMemoStr` indexes `PIC_NAME_INFO` records directly and matches
  retail with the file-local `neta_sort` definition described below.
- `CInventUserData::ResetAddress` unrolls eight photo pointers per iteration. A
  typed `photo_work` row pointer preserves the loop shape, but MWCC hoists its base
  calculation and chooses different constants for the unrolled addresses. Direct
  `&photo_work[index][0]` indexing scores 60.0%, while the previous byte-offset
  expression scored 99.583336% but used raw pointer arithmetic. The typed draft
  remains under `NONMATCHING`; the matching build uses retail assembly.

## Unresolved
- Meaning of most unk_ fields of CMenuInvent; mode values 4 and 8.
- Exact sizes of CInventUserData and CScoopDataManager.
- MenuInventInit third parameter unused in what Ghidra shows.
- LevelCheck / CheckMakeItem / LoadAnalyzeInventFile / GetPhotoNameStr look bool-returning in
  Ghidra; declared int.

## Invention memo sorting linkage

`neta_sort` sorts one half-open range of the discovered idea list, exchanging each entry's name value, sort key and signed halfword idea identifier together. Both supported mode values currently use the same ascending key comparison, and the return flag records whether any pair was swapped. The helper is file-local and defined before `CMenuInvent::UpdataNetaMemoStr`. This linkage lets MWCC retain the unchanged sort-key pointer in the caller-saved argument register between the two range sorts. `UpdataNetaMemoStr` gathers known ideas, separates identifiers below 1000 from the other identifiers, repeatedly sorts both ranges until stable, and clears the unused list tail. Its native 404-byte body now has zero differing instruction or relocation fields in the PAL checker; no data or caller interfaces change.

## Debug inventory floating argument calibration

`MenuInventDebugDraw__Fv` uses stable binary32 selectors for 300.0f
(`0x43960000`, evaluate first), 270.0f (`0x43870000`, evaluate last), and
80.0f (`0x42a00000`, evaluate first). These preserve retail's materialization
order for the debug panel rectangle without occurrence counters. With the
artificial division primer removed and helper masks GPR `0x30` / FPR `0`, the
complete unit passes canonical bytes and resolved relocations: `0xFF38` checked
bytes and 2,786 relocations.
