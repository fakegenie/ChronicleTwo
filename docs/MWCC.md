# MWCC 3.0 matching notes

ChronicleTwo game source uses MWCC 3.0-011126 with `-O3,p`, readonly strings,
exceptions and RTTI disabled, and division checks enabled. The
[Satan's Fiddle integration](../scripts/build/SATANSFIDDLE.md) makes verified
compiler state explicit without changing game source. The executable hash and
hook opcode signatures must match; a version string alone cannot authorize a
memory hook.

## Verified compiler state

**Helper-call history.** Compiler helpers accumulate masks of argument registers
they read. These masks survive translation-unit boundaries during a combined
compile, changing interference and register allocation in later functions.
The profile seeds integer and floating helper masks at translation-unit entry;
normal helper calls still accumulate history afterward. These masks describe
helper arguments, not a general register reservation policy.

Direct measurements in this pinned 3.0 compiler establish GPR mask `0x30` for
unsigned 64-bit division and `0x10` for double-to-float conversion, with FPR mask
zero in both cases. The calibrated unit rows use `0x30`, except `nd_meswin.cpp`
uses `0x10`. Do not insert non-retail functions in discarded sections to seed
this history. Replacing those functions with profile rows preserves every
allocated byte and resolved relocation, including existing unmatched functions.

**Floating argument evaluation order.** A floating constant's internal
evaluate-first byte can retain compiler-arena contents. Call lowering uses
that byte to decide whether to materialize an argument in its early walk.
Initializing the annotation path alone is insufficient: lowering can create
fresh constant nodes afterward. The verified argument-consumer hook initializes
direct constants before the read and reapplies stable overrides. Verified
assignment wrappers and compiler-registered pooled literal loads are recognized
for explicit selectors; ordinary variable expressions keep normal annotation.

Expression identities comprise source basename, mangled enclosing function,
binary32/binary64 type and exact IEEE bits. An optional mangled `callee` resolves
different requirements for the same value in one function. Scoped rows apply at
consumption and take precedence over unscoped rows. No occurrence counts,
ordinals, instruction addresses or compiler-arena addresses select expressions.
Unmatched selectors are errors, so source changes cannot silently leave stale
calibration behind. Signed zero and NaN payloads remain distinct identities.

**Native floating-point compatibility.** The translation-unit flag
`native_floating_point` leaves the original compiler's floating annotations
and argument lowering intact. `actionchara.cpp`, `actscript.cpp` and
`nd_meswin.cpp` use this mode to reproduce the schedules from the verified
`216512e1` build. Compiler hash/signature checks and helper-mask initialization
remain active; `nd_meswin` retains GPR mask `0x10`. Native mode rejects floating
expression and literal overrides for the same unit. It preserves the original
compiler's source sensitivity, so acceptance requires complete object and
linked retail comparisons. Other units retain deterministic annotations.

**Pooled literal aliasing.** The separate bug that treats a literal's value buffer
as variable alias metadata is verified for MWCC 2.3.3. No affected alias path is
validated for this 3.0 image. It can pool constants under other optimization
options, including `-O2`; that does not establish the alias bug. The 3.0 profile
therefore omits literal-reload policy settings.

## Retail calibration examples

| Translation unit and function | Verified scheduling policy |
|---|---|
| `mapjump.cpp`, `ExitInterior__FP6CScenePi` | binary32 zero (`0x00000000`) first restores the retail stack frame and float preservation across the angle-limit call. |
| `pbuggy.cpp`, `InitBomb__FP6CScene` | binary32 pi (`0x40490fdb`) first restores the retail instruction order. |
| `dngmenu.cpp`, `Initialize__11CDngFreeMapFv` | binary32 286 (`0x438f0000`) first restores the initial rectangle argument order; the whole unit passes after native promotions. |
| `event_func.cpp`, `_SET_CROSSFADE__FP12RS_STACKDATAi` | binary32 one (`0x3f800000`) first only for `CrossFadeOut__10CFadeInOutFiif`; sibling `CrossFadeIn` and `CrossFade` calls retain false. |
| `scenesnd.cpp`, `SePlayFoot__6CSceneFiiPf` | binary32 1200 (`0x44960000`) first emits it before 160, as retail does. |
| `gyoracesim.cpp`, `CharacterBonus__FP12grFISH_PARAMP15RACE_FISH_PARAMi` | zero and 0.01 (`0x3c23d70a`) first preserve both the earlier zero/0.01 calls and the later call's 0.01-before-one materialization. |

These rows were accepted through the canonical object comparison. They establish
the listed functions' bytes and resolved relocations, not whole-unit matching
when other source or data-layout failures remain.
Unit-specific evidence is in the tracked mapjump and event_func RE notes and
[pbuggy calibration notes](../ps2/re/docs/pbuggy/notes.md).

## Source matching and verification

Read unit documentation first and analyze retail with `./decompile.sh SYMBOL`
using m2c. Establish dependency types and layouts before changing expressions.
An early `mtc1`, changed saved register or changed stack frame can be a compiler
state difference; test the deterministic profile before changing source to
imitate incidental allocation. Use correctly typed literals and real field
layouts rather than pointer arithmetic or instruction-shaped source.

For each calibration, copy the profile privately, compile with the repository
wrapper and canonical flags, run `scripts/build/fixup_sections.sh`, then run
`scripts/build/check_objects.py`. Accept a row only when the target has zero
byte and resolved-relocation differences and existing unit failures are
preserved or resolved. Fixup is required: mwccgap's temporary `.dead` sections
are removed by the normal build stage.

Objdiff source-only objects use the same Satan's Fiddle profile as linked
objects; native template names are mapped structurally to retail identities.
The objdiff target preparation localizes explicit switch `jlabel .LXXXXXXXX`
symbols so they do not split native functions into artificial report rows.
This changes only the comparison object's symbol metadata; the linked game
objects retain the exported labels required by separately assembled tables.
A fuzzy percentage is diagnostic, not proof of an exact match. `INCLUDE_ASM`
and inline assembly do not qualify as matched native decompilation. Internal
class initializers must be generated naturally by the compiler.

## Data extents and alignment

Retail symbol sizes describe objects, while the split section pieces include
the alignment gap before the next symbol or referenced address. Once data
sections are assigned alignment one for linking, their bytes must retain that
gap. The postprocessor extends a correctly sized native object by fewer than
16 bytes to its piece boundary; initialized padding must be zero in retail.
An object with a size different from its declared retail size is not padded.
Referenced interior addresses remain separate piece boundaries.

A terminal function may end before the next unit's address when the generated
linker script supplies the intervening alignment. The canonical checker permits
this only at the exact `contents_end` established by the script and only for an
all-zero retail tail. Objdiff target symbol metadata records declared retail
function sizes so the same linker padding is excluded from function scores.

## Natural C++ definitions

MWCC generates constructor vtable writes and C++ symbol names from class
definitions. Keep member functions and constructors in C++ form so the compiler
emits those symbols. A local `divbyzerocheck` pragma needs demonstrated code
generation evidence because that option is enabled by the shared flags.

Compare complete objects as well as individual functions: emitted inline
helpers, static initializers and data sizes can change the containing unit.
The PAL executable verifier checks the final linked layout afterward.
