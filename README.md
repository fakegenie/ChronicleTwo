Chronicle Two is a decompilation project (and eventual port) of Dark
Chronicle/Dark Cloud 2 for the PlayStation 2.

# Building and running

1. Clone the repository with `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/TheMoonPeople/ChronicleTwo.git`
2. Place the PAL retail build named `Dark Chronicle (PAL).iso` in the `rom/pal/` folder at the root of the project.
3. Build [Satan's Fiddle](https://github.com/Adubbz/SatansFiddle) with the pinned revision and compatibility patch described in [the compiler integration notes](scripts/build/SATANSFIDDLE.md). Set `SATANSFIDDLE` to the resulting executable, or place `satansfiddle` on `PATH`. The Docker image builds this toolchain automatically.
4. Run `build.sh`.

`build.sh` builds the game.
`run.sh` builds the disc image and boots it in PCSX2.

MWCC 3.0 compilation runs through Satan's Fiddle using
[the JSON profile](scripts/build/satansfiddle.json). `SATANSFIDDLE_CONFIG` selects
a different profile. CMake also accepts `-DSATANSFIDDLE=/absolute/path/satansfiddle`
and `-DSATANSFIDDLE_CONFIG=/absolute/path/profile.json`; these cached settings
take precedence over later environment changes. MWLD still runs under plain `wibo`.
See [the compiler integration notes](scripts/build/SATANSFIDDLE.md) for the wrapper,
selectors, and validation commands.
